  <h1>Structural patterns - how objects relate to each other</h1>
  <h1>Behavioral patterns - how objects communicating with each other</h1>

  <span>In summary, creational design patterns focus on object creation, structural design patterns focus on the composition of objects and classes, and behavioral design patterns focus on the communication between objects.</span>
  <ul>
    <li>
     <bold>Creational patterns</bold> include Abstract Factory, Builder, Factory Method, Prototype and Singleton.
    </li>
    <li>
      <bold>Structural Patterns </bold>consist of Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight and Proxy.

      <p>
        Structural design patterns are about organizing objects and classes to form larger structures,</p>
        <p> Organize classes and objects.</p>
        <p>
          Imagine you're building a house. In the construction process, you have various components like bricks, concrete, steel beams, and windows. Structural design patterns are like the blueprints and guidelines that help you arrange and organize these components to create the overall structure of the house.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>Behavioral Patterns</li>the largest category, feature Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Template Method and Visitor.
  </ul>

  <p>unlike algorithms, you can't copy past from anywhere, you need to use your brain for patterns.</p>
