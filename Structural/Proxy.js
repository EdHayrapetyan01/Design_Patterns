// The Proxy pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to
// control access to it. It allows you to add an extra layer of control over an object,
// without the client code being aware of it. This can be useful for various purposes,
// including lazy loading, access control, monitoring, and more.
